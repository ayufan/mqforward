mqforward
=====================

mqforward is forwarder from MQTT to Influxdb.
This subscribes a topic with wildcard and forward a payload to
Influxdb. The value should be JSON or msgpack.

for example,

- Publish ``{"a": 1, "b": 2}`` to "mqforward/a/b", 
- Subscribe "mqforward/#", 

in the influxdb,

- value ``a=1 and b=2`` into the a.b series. so you can ``SELECT a, b FROM "a.b"``


If udp is true in the config, send series over UDP to InfluxDB. otherwise, use HTTP.
